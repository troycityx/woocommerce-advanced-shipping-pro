The most powerful conditional shipping plugin for WooCommerce. Go beyond free shipping with advanced rules, box packing, delivery dates, and smart restrictions.

== Description ==

= Take Complete Control of Your WooCommerce Shipping =

WooCommerce Advanced Shipping Pro is the ultimate solution for stores that need sophisticated shipping rules beyond WooCommerce's basic capabilities. Built on years of real merchant feedback from the original Advanced Free Shipping plugin, this pro version adds enterprise-level features that solve the most complex shipping challenges.

= Why Stores Upgrade to Advanced Shipping Pro =

**Online retailers lose 28% of potential revenue** due to abandoned carts caused by incorrect shipping calculations. Our pro features address the exact pain points that cause cart abandonment:

* **Overcharging for multiple items** instead of consolidating into boxes
* **No way to block restricted products** from certain locations
* **Missing delivery date estimates** that customers expect
* **Complex shipping rules** that basic plugins can't handle

= Key Features =

= SMART BOX PACKING & CONSOLIDATED RATES =

Stop losing money by charging per-item shipping! Our advanced box packing algorithm:

* **Virtual Box Packing**: Automatically packs cart items into your predefined box sizes
* **Least Cost Routing**: Calculates shipping based on packed boxes, not individual items
* **Consolidation Logic**: Combines multiple items into single shipments when possible
* **Restricted Items**: Prevent specific products (fragile, hazardous) from packing with others
* **Dimensional Support**: Uses product dimensions (LxWxH) and weight for accurate calculations

*Example: Instead of charging $9 × 10 items = $90, pack into one box for $15 total*

= ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS & SMART MESSAGING =

Go beyond hiding shipping methods - completely control the checkout experience:

* **Checkout Blocking**: Prevent purchases when conditions aren't met
* **Real-time Messaging**: Show custom messages based on cart contents and destination
* **PO Box Detection**: Automatically block shipping to PO Box addresses
* **Geographic Restrictions**: Restrict products by country, state, or zipcode
* **Product Combinations**: Block specific product combinations from being purchased together

*Example: "We cannot ship vaping products to Texas. Please remove these items to continue."*

= ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE CALCULATOR =

Set customer expectations with accurate delivery estimates:

* **Business Day Logic**: Define your operating days and cutoff times
* **Transit Time Rules**: Set different delivery estimates per shipping method/zone
* **Holiday Management**: Account for store closures and national holidays
* **Real-time Display**: Show estimated dates next to shipping methods
* **Shortcode Support**: Display delivery estimates anywhere on your site

*Example: "Free Shipping (Est. Delivery: Tuesday, Nov 27)"*

= CORE CONDITION ENGINE =

The powerful rules engine that makes it all possible:

* **60+ Condition Types**: Products, categories, cart totals, user roles, locations, and more
* **AND/OR Logic Groups**: Create complex rules with multiple condition groups
* **Real-time Calculation**: Instant shipping updates as customers shop
* **Visual Rule Builder**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
* **WooCommerce Native**: Fully integrated with WooCommerce shipping zones

= Perfect For =

* **Multi-product stores** with complex shipping needs
* **Businesses using actual box sizes** for shipping calculations
* **Stores with geographic restrictions** (alcohol, tobacco, perishables)
*  **Merchants who ship fragile or restricted items**
* **Businesses needing delivery date promises**
* **Stores losing money on incorrect shipping calculations**

= Pro vs Free Comparison =


= Installation =

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-advanced-shipping-pro`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Navigate to WooCommerce → Settings → Shipping to configure shipping rules
4. Go to WooCommerce → Advanced Shipping Pro to configure pro features

= Frequently Asked Questions =

= How does the box packing work? =
The plugin uses a bin-packing algorithm to virtually pack your cart items into the box sizes you define. It considers dimensions, weight, and any packing restrictions you set up.

= Can I restrict products by state or country? =
Yes! The restrictions system uses the same powerful condition engine as shipping rules. You can block specific products, categories, or combinations based on shipping destination.

= How accurate are the delivery dates? =
Delivery dates consider your business days, order cutoff times, processing time, transit time, and holidays. They're as accurate as the information you provide.

= Will this work with my current shipping plugins? =
Advanced Shipping Pro works alongside most WooCommerce shipping plugins and can complement services like WooCommerce Shipping, ShipStation, and others.

= Can I upgrade from the free version? =
Yes! All your existing shipping rules will be preserved when you upgrade to the pro version.
